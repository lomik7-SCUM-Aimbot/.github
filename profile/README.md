**Safety Tips:**
Even with the most advanced, undetected tools, intelligent usage is paramount for long-term account security.

  * **Disable VPN:** Some anti-cheat systems may flag VPN usage, potentially causing false positives. Ensure it's off while gaming.
  * **Temporarily Disable Antivirus/Firewall:** Your security software might mistakenly interfere with the aimbot. Whitelist its folder or temporarily disable it during use.
  * **Keep Game Client Updated:** Always ensure your SCUM game client is updated to the absolute latest version before launching the aimbot. This ensures compatibility and reduces detection risk.
  * **Run as Administrator:** Launch `SCUMLoader.exe` with administrator privileges to ensure proper functionality and seamless injection.
  * **Whitelist Installation Folder:** Add the tool's directory to your antivirus exceptions to prevent accidental deletion or quarantining.
  * **Strategic Play & Subtlety:** While our software is covert, your *actions* are visible. Avoid blatantly obvious moves like perfectly tracking targets through walls, snapping instantly, or getting an absurd number of consecutive headshots. Use the "smooth aim" and "humanization" features to make your enhanced performance appear as genuine skill\!
  * **Utilize HWID Spoofing:** If you've encountered previous bans, leverage our integrated or recommended hardware ID spoofing features to shield against residual hardware flags on new accounts.
